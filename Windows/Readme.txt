This is a beta version of FSFDT Windows FSD server

USAGE : FSD
        /INSTALL : Install as Autostart Windows service
        /UNINSTALL : Uninstall service
	/RUN : Run Interactive


Once installed as service, you can control its start/stop
thru Administration tools/Services.

FSD looks and writes file in the directory where fsd.exe is, 
so never separate directory between fsd.exe and config files.
